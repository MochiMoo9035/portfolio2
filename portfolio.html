        <h1 class="center"><b> Week 1: </b></h1>
        <p class="center"> In the first week of STEM League, I was introduced to wed development as a whole. I have never done any web development before like this and it was really fun to explore this part of programming. In the first week, we used basic skills like header and paragrapgh tags to create a rough "About me!" project. Keep in mind, in the first week, I only learned HTML. I also did a donut cat activity where I learned how to inspect pages.

        <h1 class="center"><b> Week 2: </b></h1>
        <p class = "center">This week, I learned about Flexbox, which is a type of display type in which you can organize elemnts in carious ways. For example, you can align items in different ways and even make it so that the items will move on to the next line when the screen size changes. We did a card collection activity where I made a card collection based on food. There's a prank at the end which <i>I</i> implemented which I found amusing. We also learned about buttons and animations the next day, which we implemented into an "Animation Magic" project the next day! That one also has a prank, but I won't tell you where it is. ðŸ˜‰
        <br>
        <a href="https://flex.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE for my Flexbox project. The left image's width changes when you make the screen smaller or bigger, but the right image's doesn't! This is an example of Flexbox</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://foodinfo.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE for the Food Cards project I made! In this project, I learned a lot about using CSS to make site layouts appealing to the eye.</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://animation-magic.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE for an animation project I did which ALSO has a prank in it. I did come along some hardships when I tried to implement TWO anumations into one element, but one of the mentors from the program helped me and I got it fixed!</a>

        <h1 class="center">Week 3: </h1>
        <p class="center"> This week, I FINALLY learned about JS and what it is! Also, this week I had an optional Harry Potter activity throughout the whole week. Kids who were in Web Dev made a website for their house in a group, and we did a coding quidditch match at the end of the week too! In the standard curriculum, I learned about how to use "console.log" to check for bugs on websites, I learned how to format JS functions, I used an onclick function for a project I did using minions, and the "prompt" and "alert" commands. 
        <br>
         <a href="https://minions.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE to view my Minions GIF project. The input field for the GIF is CASE SENSITIVE and other spelling will not work. This is because back then, I did not know how to change it so things are not case sensitive, so it is a pretty amateur project.</a>
         <br>
         <a href="https://hufflepuff.stemleague.repl.co/common_room.html">Click HERE to see the website for the Hufflepuff House in Harry Potter. I DO NOT take all the credit for this, because we ALL worked on this together. There is a password for the common room. It will give you the first 3 barrels, and the last barrel you have to click is the one on the very bottom.</a>

      <div class = "card">
        <h1 class="center"> Week 4: </h1>
        <p class="center">This week, I learned about the DOM, or Document Object Model. This is essentially how components in a website are organized by the computer, and how you can edit those NOT with HTML but with Javascript. We did a pretty simple project in which three heroes battle a dragon. It is not a functional game, but It shows how you can select elements by manipulating the DOM and you can make it so that when a user clicks a character, they change opacity and their weapons change too. Also, I learned about events and used what I learned in a Jurassic Park project. This week, I also did an Escape Room. The past weeks, the Escape Rooms were for the data programming track, which I am not part of, but this week I did a MINECRAFT Escape Room. It was pretty challenging and I could not complete it fully, but I learned a WHOLE LOT about DOM manipulation and how to add and remove elemnts using JS. 
        <br>
        <a href="https://knights.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE to view my Heroes and Dragon project. The archer (orange haired-lady's) weapon does not show up due to the image being glitchy. You can click on the heroes to change the others' opacities and view all the weapons. I animated the elements using CSS</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://jurassic-world.mochimoo.repl.co/"/>Click HERE to view my Jurassic Park project. You can play the music in the beginning, but if you start the game without it, you can't play it unless you reload the page. Once you click play, you will have to click all the dinosaurs until they all have a logo on them, then you have to press the finish button to finish the game.</a>
        <br>
        <a href = "https://minecraft-challenge-1.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE to view the Minecraft Challenge. As I said above, I have NOT finished it all and the one that works the MOST is challenge 2.</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://minecraft-answer.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE to experience the FULL Minecraft Challenge activity. This is an answer key made by the mentor who created this in the STEM League program. This helped me understand how to do some of the challenges and helped me learn more about HTML, CSS, and JS and again, a LOT more about DOM manipulation.</a>

        <h1 class="center"> Week 5: </h1>
        <p class="center">This week, I learned about Loops and Arrays, which are fundamental parts in JS. Also, we had something like the Harry Potter themed week, except this time, with movie/book series. I also made a random image generator and one of my FAVORITE activities in the STEM League program: the Tic-Tac-Toe activity. This was an activity that was pretty long and a bit complicated, but It was still fun.  We also had a Demi-God Adventures Escape Room, which was, again, pretty challenging so I could not complete it fully, but it was fun.
        <br>
        <a href="https://seuss-landing.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE for the Dr. Seuss themed Random Image Generator. I barely had ANY idea on how to do this activity, but I learned a lot with some help from Mentors.

        <h1 class="center"> Week 6:</h1>
        <p class="center"> Week 6 is the week where we began our final Hackathoni projects, like this one. We did watch some videos about cloud computing and some other informational videos, but there weren't any real ACTIVITIES like the other weeks. There was a Search Filter activity but that was to mainly provide some inspiration for peoples' hackathon projects. Because of this, there are no project links for this week.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "card">
        <h1 class="center"> Week: 7</h1>
        <p class="center">This week, we watched a few videos on Web APIs (which I don't fully understand yet ðŸ˜†) and UX design, which I thought was cool. We also had a Cookie Party workshop and an ANimal Crossing Escape Room activity. The Cookie Party activity was pretty challenging, but I completed all of it. The Animal Crossing Adventures Escape Room was also a bit challenging, but I finished all the levels that were not marked as optional. This week was pretty fun, and I really liked the Cookie Party activity.
        <br>
        <a href="https://cookie-party.mochimoo.repl.co/">Click HERE for the Cookie Party activity. This one was pretty fun, and we got to use a LOT of Javascript and the idea was pretty cute!</a>

        <a href="https://ac-adventures.mochimoo.repl.co/index.html">Click HERE to view the Animal Crossing Escape Room. Only the first two challenges are functional, because the other two are optional activities. This activity was a bit boring, but I learned a bit more about DOM manipulation and about what <1>can</i> and what <i>cannot</i> be dome with DOM manipulation commands.</a>

        <h1 class="center">Week: 8 </h1>
        <p class="center"> This was the FINAL week of the STEM League program, and I worked on THIS hackathon project from weeks 6-8. THe whole STEM League experience was REALLY fun and I would definitely do this again if it were available next summer or during the school year. I'm really excited for the End of League graduation, but also a bit sad that STEM League is over. I really appreciate all the hard work and dedication the montors have shown throughout the whole 8 weeks and I also had fun with all the different students from around the US, Canada, and even the world, because we all got to work together and have fun.</p>
